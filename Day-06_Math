Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.

SOLUTION

C++
class Solution {
public:
    int totalMoney(int n) {
        int cnt=0;
        int ans=0;
        while(n-7>=0)
        {
            ans+=28+cnt*7;
            cnt++;
            n-=7;
        }
        ans+=(n*(n+1))/2;
        ans+=(n*cnt);

        return ans;
        
    }
};
