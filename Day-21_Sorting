1637. Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points

STATEMENT
Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that 
no points are inside the area.
A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). 
The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.
Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.
